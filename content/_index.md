    Welcome! My name is Zan, and I'm a PhD Candidate in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University and an American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellow. My research interests lie somewhere in the intersection of  AI/ML, high dimensional statistics, computational modeling, and medicine/physiology. You can find more details about my work on this site.
