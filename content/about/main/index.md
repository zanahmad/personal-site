intro: |
 I began my Ph.D. in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics (AMS) at Johns Hopkins University in June 2022. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Natalia Trayanova in the Computational Cardiology Lab. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in Mathematics and Chemistry at New York University from 2017-2020. During that time, I began working on mathematical biology research under Professors Charles Peskin and Charles Puelz. Prior to beginning my graduate studies at Johns Hopkins, I spent a year as a computational neuroscience researcher at Yale School of Medicine under Professor Hal Blumenfeld. 

 My current research interests are cardiovascular fluid dynamics modeling, machine learning/neural operators, shape analysis and high dimensional statistics. I am interested in the development and application of mathematical and computational tools in these domains to design a rigorous and personalized metric for stroke risk assessment in atrial fibrillation patients.
