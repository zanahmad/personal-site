intro: |
 I joined the **Johns Hopkins University** Applied Mathematics and Statistics PhD program in June 2022. Since then, I have been a graduate researcher in the **[Computational Cardiology Lab](https://www.trayanovalab.org/)** where I am fortunate to be advised by  **[Natalia Trayanova](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oY3ePQ8AAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Mauro Maggioni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e6JywScAAAAJ&hl=en)**.  My current research interests involve scientific machine learning for accelerating cardiovascular modeling and simulation. I am grateful to have been supported by several training grants and fellowships throughout my academic career with the most recent being the **[American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship](https://proposalcentral.com/Insights/yK3zgRfRQcI=/Public/AwardDetails/1196125)** (2024-2026).
 
 I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics (Honors) from  **New York University**'s **[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/)**, with minors in Chemistry and Film Production. During my time there, I worked on mathematical biology research under **[Charles S. Peskin](https://math.nyu.edu/~peskin/)** and **[Charles Puelz](https://cpuelz.github.io/)**. Prior to beginning my graduate studies, I spent a year as a computational neuroscience research scientist at **Yale University** under  **[Hal Blumenfeld](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6oR4-dMAAAAJ&hl=en)**.
