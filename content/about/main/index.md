 I began my Ph.D. in June 2022 at the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) in the  [Computational Cardiology Lab](https://www.trayanovalab.org/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Natalia Trayanova](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oY3ePQ8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Professor Mauro Maggioni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e6JywScAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interests are in cardiovascular modeling, neural operators for PDEs, medical shape analysis, computational anatomy and high dimensional statistics. I am grateful to have been supported by several training grants and fellowships throughout my graduate studies including the American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship (2024-2026).
 
 During my undergraduate studies at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), I majored in Mathematics with minors in Chemistry and Film Production and worked on mathematical biology research under [Professor Charles Peskin](https://math.nyu.edu/~peskin/) and [Professor Charles Puelz](https://cpuelz.github.io/). Prior to beginning my graduate studies at Johns Hopkins, I spent a year as a computational neuroscience researcher at [Yale School of Medicine Department of Neurology](https://medicine.yale.edu/neurology/)  under [Professor Hal Blumenfeld](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/blumenfeld/). 
 
  Outside of research, I enjoy composing instrumental guitar music. You can find my original music on  [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2X8bjHHLiqividQ9xnbB64?si=XKjY8vSmT8yhx_2ZzpjzBg).
